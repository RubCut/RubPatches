"""The bot's chatterbox for groups: it learns which word follows which and
now and then says something back.

Not a neural network. Every message in a chat where it is switched on is cut
into words, and for every two words in a row the word after them is counted.
To say something it starts from a word of the message it answers, so a chat
that was on about a virus in MargyT may hear "удалите вирус маргит", and walks
on, each next word picked by how often it came after the two before it.

It is off until an admin of the chat switches it on, and while off it neither
learns nor speaks. What it keeps is these word links, per chat, and "forget"
wipes them. Links and @names are never learned: it is not to tag anybody.
