"""The panel's powers from inside TikTok, for the owner, on a phone he approved.

Three things have to agree before anything is done:

- the account: proved by writing into its bio (``vouched``) and wearing the
  owner badge, the same as the old ``/verdict`` asked;
- the device: a key made in the phone's keystore, which never leaves it,
  shown to the server once and approved with a code sent to the owner's
  Telegram;
- the request: signed by that key, made in the last two minutes and never
  seen before.

A stolen token alone does nothing, and neither does a copied request. A lost
phone is struck off in the panel, or from another approved phone.
