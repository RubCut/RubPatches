/**
 * How long the app stopped for, and what it was doing, written down.
 *
 * "It freezes" is not something anyone can act on, and neither is a guess
 * about why. The main thread draws a frame every sixteen milliseconds when
 * all is well, so a gap much larger than that is a stall somebody felt, and
 * the diary can say how long and how often.
 *
 * How long was all it used to say, and that turned out not to be enough: a
 * person whose feed stalls can copy a diary full of "stopped for 1800 ms" and
 * nobody is any the wiser. So a second thread looks in now and then, and when
 * no frame has been drawn for a while it asks the main thread where it is.
 * That is the line worth having -- and where the main thread turns out to be
 * waiting for something to do, it was not a stall at all, only a screen with
 * nothing to draw, and nothing is written.
 *
 * The cost is one comparison per frame and a wake-up four times a second
 * that reads one number. The stack is taken only during a stall.
